# CSS Grids Demonstration
The index is currently a bare bones show case for CSS grid structuring. Six child elements are nested within a parent element
that is set to "Display: grid;" and has the appropriate media queries to respond to screens of 3 sizes, ideally suited for
mobile, tablet, and desktop orientations. No frameworks were used, only CSS rules.
